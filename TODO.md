- create config file
- allow configure size of memtable in MB.
- Add some form of cache for sstables. Maybe a confguration on how many MB of sstable cache is allowed.
- Some way of configuring merging process. Max number of sstables? Merge when CPU usage is low enough?
- Allow merging only some sstables (maybe just a thread that continuosly merges two tables?)
